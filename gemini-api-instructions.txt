//The Gemini SDK lets you collect multiple rounds of questions and responses, allowing users to step incrementally toward answers or get //help with multipart problems. This SDK feature provides an interface to keep track of conversations history, but behind the scenes uses //the same generateContent method to create the response.

The following code example shows a basic chat implementation:
//Make sure to include these imports:
//import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from "@google/generative-ai";
const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI("GEMINI_API_KEY");
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-2.0-flash" });
const chat = model.startChat({
  history: [
    {
      role: "user",
      parts: [{ text: "Hello" }],
    },
    {
      role: "model",
      parts: [{ text: "Great to meet you. What would you like to know?" }],
    },
  ],
});

let result = await chat.sendMessage("I have 2 dogs in my house.");
console.log(result.response.text());
let result2 = await chat.sendMessage("How many paws are in my house?");
console.log(result2.response.text());
